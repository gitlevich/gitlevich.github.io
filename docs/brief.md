# Agent.Farm Single-Page Website + Logo Brief

## Overview & Goals

We are **Agent.Farm**, a small business AI consulting startup specializing in **domain-specific (vertical) AI agents**.
Our primary differentiator: we don’t offer generic AI solutions—we train “agentic assistants” that truly know **your**
business, **your** terminology, and **your** workflows, acting like specialized staff. We need a **single-page** website
that’s modern, clean, and subtly references the “farm” concept—without relying on typical browns/greens. The site must
convey **professionalism** and **approachability** for small business owners.

**Key Message**:
> “We cultivate custom AI ‘staff’ for your unique business needs.”

**Deliverables**:

- **Logo design** (minimal “farm meets tech” concept)
- **Single-page site design** (desktop + mobile responsive mockups)
- **Ready-for-deployment HTML/CSS/JS package** (GitHub Pages-compatible)

## Aesthetic & Brand Direction

1. **Minimal & Modern**

- Draw inspiration from [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Airtable](https://airtable.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for
  clean lines, ample white space, and subtle accent colors.
- Font style: **Sans-serif**, modern and readable. Avoid clutter or oversized elements.

2. **Light Farm Theme**

- Subtle visual nods (e.g., line-art fields or geometric “crop” patterns) to hint at growing and cultivating AI.
- Witty section headers if possible (“Harvest Intelligence,” “Grow Your AI Workforce”) but keep it tasteful.

3. **Color Palette**

- Predominantly **white background** + **black/gray text**.
- One **bold accent color** (designer’s choice: bright green/blue/teal/orange) used sparingly.
